									<h2>Industry Data</h2>
									<p>After looking at the top burning glass occupations listed in Burning Glass Technologies (2018), I realised that some of the ideal jobs chosen are highly in demand in the IT industry for example like Software Developer are sought by 29456 employers. It is then followed by systems analyst that is sought by 11492 employers. Help desk officers are wanted by 9416 employers. Software tester is required by 4261 employers and lastly cyber security is required by 2914 employers. The highest experience requirements for IT professionals in Burning Glass Technologies (2018) are three to five years which is needed by 4655 employers.</p>

										<li>Teamwork
										<li>Planning
										<li>Detail-oriented




									</p>
									<p>Focusing on various aspects of the IT industry and on other fields such as Logistics and supply chain management, the group has a varied range of career options. All career pathways require a specific IT skill set. Ranging from SAP software to SQL and Java, the group members are working on building these skill sets for their ideal job.</p>

									<p>2 out of 7 people in the group have SQL as a required skill set. According to the Burning Glass Data SQL has the highest demand according to the latest data with more than 3,570 jobs, SQL leads the chart. The other most popular IT skill required amongst the team is Microsoft Windows. This skill set is the 4th most required skill set in the field with 2,699 job available in 90 days. .NET programming is also one of the most demanded skill in the market. With more than 1,370 jobs in 90 days, NET programming is ranked at number 16. Delivery station manager is a logistics job which also predominantly uses SAP as their base system. SAP software skills are ranked 6th in the top IT skills chart with 2,189 job in 90 days. Oracle is another skill that is on demand and is also a requirement for the chosen career paths. With 1,313 jobs in 90 days.</p>

									<p>From the data from Burning Glass Technologies (2018), the general skill the most sought for by employers is communication skills of 44367 employers. Communication skill is needed for IT professionals as it is required to communicate effectively with colleagues and supervisors in solving technology problems, it also helps with communicating ideas to teams(Comptia, 2020). </p>

									<p>Problem solving is the second highest demanded skill of 16445 selections. As IT continues to progress, there would be new problems that would need to be solved and the ideal jobs selected deals with clients most of the time, being able to solve their problems are the main importance as an IT personnel.</p>

									<p>Organisational skills is the third similar skill required for these jobs and it is selected by 15844 employers. Employers seek workers that are able to multitask and at the same time organise their work efficiently, this will help promote high performance and being able to fulfill tasks given (Comptia, 2020). </p>

									<p>Writing skill is the fourth most important skill set to have and it is wanted by 15590 employers. Email communication is also highly used by most jobs. Sending a good email is important as it will represent the company and building a good relationship with clients would positively impact the company. </p>

									<p>Teamwork is a huge part of most of the ideal jobs selected that is required by 14364 employers. Working with colleagues effectively and understanding their points of view will speed up finding solutions and finishing tasks better (Brooks, 2019). There would be less problems within the company if employees are able to work with each other. </p>

									<p>Planning skills are desired by 11315 employers and the last in ranking of importance is the skill of detail-oriented employees that is sought for by 8298 employers. In order to finish work on time, employees need to plan their work according to importance. </p>

									<p>With 7 members in the group and with varied job titles that requires more than one IT skill set, there are very few IT skills that have not been mentioned in the IT skill set. Java Script though ranked 2nd in the skill demand list, is not a prerequisite IT skill for any of the job. It could be a great skill that could be added on to some of the job titles such as ‘IT Service Desk or PHP/.NET developer’. This skill could increase the likely hood of getting job. Java Script has 2,946 jobs every 90 days.</p>

									<p>Other Skills that are not included in the groups required skill set are Business management, Project management, Building Relationships, Business analysis, Graphic design, website production, ITIL and business Process. These skills are not placed in the top 5 of the skill set but they also have on average more than 1,300 jobs every 90 days. Linux is also not a preferred skill set for the selected jobs, but including these skills as an additional skill for the service desk of system analyst type of jobs, can act as advantage when applying for jobs. LINUX has more than 1.632 jobs in 90 days.</p>

									<p>Most of the skill that are not required by the group are focused on business sector. This could also be the reason why this is not a required skill set by most of the group members selected careers.</p>

									<p>Knowing the job demands for these non-required skill set has made the team realise that, adding a few extra skills than what is not a minimum requirement to the job title can help the members get a better offer in the job market. The outcome of this is that the group will improve their skill sets in other language, to receive a better place in the job market. </p>

									<p>The top three general skills stated in Burning Glass Technologies (2018) that are not required in the skill set of our ideal jobs are self-starter, presentation skills and quality assurance and control. Quality assurance and control skills are required by 4444 employers, while presentation skills are required by 3716 employers.</p>

									<p>There is limited need for quality assurance and control skills required for the ideal jobs except for PHP/.NET developer job, most of the jobs require standard operating procedures to be followed to ensure that systems work effectively. Presentation skills are less required for the jobs because most of the time those jobs require solving clients’ problems. Self-starter skill is required by 1984 employers. Most of the jobs listed require coordination with team members to brainstorm ideas to solve issues with systems.  </p>

									<p>After looking at Burning Glass data and relevant information of ideal job requirements, I realised that there are multiple skills required by employers and therefore this would give us time to improve ourselves before we apply for jobs. Understanding employers requirements could also give us preparation for what type of work we would be expected from us. </p>
