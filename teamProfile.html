									<h3>Aswathy Murali Ottur</h3>
									<p>Spending my childhood in two different vibrant countries has a huge influence on who I am and what I enjoy doing. I am currently doing a bachelor’s in Information Technology. I have always wanted to pursue a career in IT. From every phone that gets released to every PC, I have always been keen on knowing more about them and how they work. After finishing my VCE in 2018, I moved on to do a traineeship as a front desk IT support. This experience really opened up the tiny world of IT to me and also made me realize how important the role of IT is in the world we live in today. Programming is something I picked up as a teen out of interest. Java, basic python, SQL. HTML5 and CSS3 are some skills that I have learned in the past years and developing my skill sets in these is still an ongoing process.</p>

									<a id="Brandon Alguno"></a>
									<h3>Brandon Alguno</h3>
									<p>My name is Brandon Alguno and my student number is s3843731. I am 19 years old and was born in Australia with a Filipino background. I am currently studying for a Bachelor of IT, but was beginning to study a Bachelor of Business (Economics and Finance). I changed my bachelors degree because it did not interest me as much as I thought. Some of my hobbies include playing volleyball, listening to music and watching movies/TV series. My interest in IT has stemmed from high school to present as I have had influence from friends and family, and building a PC. Currently, I only have very basic IT skills, but I am very eager to learn and develop more skills as I want to be able to implement these skills in a future career.</p>

									<a id="Daniel Liu"></a>
									<h3>Daniel Liu</h3>
									<p>My name is Daniel and my student id is s3873060. I am currently doing an IT COVID-19 short course at RMIT to help expand my current skill set. I work in accounting full time but I think I might be better suited to the IT area or a combination of both. I was born in Melbourne and have lived here ever since. I play hockey competitively and have become a very avid runner during this lock down period as a substitute. I am also interested in gaming on PC (Overwatch and COD etc). I have built my own computers before and have always had a strong interest in IT. I have a strong passion for sports including AFL and NBA both of which have been able to restart during this pandemic and have given me something to watch and enjoy.</p>

									<a id="Ee Kien Toh"></a>
									<h3>Ee Kien Toh</h3>
									<p>My name is Ee Kien Toh, and my student number is s3553808. I am from Malaysia and this is my final semester studying Bachelor of Business majoring in Logistics and Supply Chain Management. Before studying in RMIT I used to study in Monash, and before that I used to live and study in Singapore for six years. Back then I was also part of a band called Take Cover and we won a few band competitions back in Singapore, also used to work in a drum shop in Singapore as well.  My hobbies are playing computer games, listening to music, playing badminton and going for a drive. My IT interest started around one year ago when I decided to build myself a desktop. I do not have much IT experience or background but however I am keen to learn more about it. </p>

									<a id="Joseph Tran"></a>
									<h3>Joseph Tran</h3>
									<p>My name is Joseph Tran and my student number is s3645554. I am 22 years of age born in Australia with a vietnamese background. I had completed VCE in 2015, and after a few years of travelling and working I now endeavour to complete a Bachelor of IT. Just a few fun facts about myself, I enjoy reading manga such as One piece and follow F1 Motorsports. Every winter, you’ll find me snowboarding whenever I get the chance to head to the ski slopes. My interest in IT had initially developed in primary school from being able to program a basic game which required creating movements for specific characters and set rules which they had to follow. I became fascinated with the concept of being able to create my own applications and the endless possibilities of ways I could design it. I only have a limited understanding of IT, knowing the basics of front-end web development using HTML and CSS. However, through my eagerness to learn more, I hope to further develop my skills and be able to implement them in the future.</p>

									<a id="Kevin Zhu"></a>
									<h3>Kevin Zhu</h3>
									<p>My name is Kevin, and my student number is s3486531. I was born in Australia with a Chinese background and my hobbies are gaming and casually playing music on piano and bass. I was originally in my second semester of Industrial Design and switched to IT due to the pandemic. My reason for getting interested in IT is from needing to learn python for a personal project in my spare time, but I also thought it would be a good experience in interacting with others. I have some experience in mostly C++, but have done some HTML and PHP when I wrote code for a simple website that focused on sending and receiving information through TCP and UDP.</p>

									<a id="Sue Wei Low"></a>
									<h3>Sue Wei Low</h3>
									<p>My name is Sue Wei Low, and my student ID is s3760175. I am from Malaysia and I am currently studying Bachelor of Business majoring in Accounting. I can speak multiple languages as I grew up in a multicultural country that consists of three major ethnic groups. I enjoy different types of music and watching movies. IT is a big part of our lives and I am interested to find out more about it and I believe it would help me in my future careers as well and it would be convenient to be able to understand different systems quicker. My brother was the first person to spark my interest in IT as he likes to tell me different facts about new technologies. As technology advances, I think it is important to keep up and constantly learn. </p>
