									<p>Due to the growing awareness of healthy eating and healthy living around the world, people are more conscious of their food intake. 75% of global respondents agree that they are what they eat and 80% of people prioritize food to prevent medical conditions or health issues (Nielson, 2015). Australia’s millennials are also conscious of their food choices and the biggest consumer group in healthy eating is 32% (Npd, 2018).
									Society has a growing concern of protecting nature and would like to lead sustainable lifestyles and having a platform to deeper understand the 7Rs of sustainability would be ideal for users to share their opinions and ideas.</p>

									<h2>Features</h2>
									<h3>Recipes:</h3>
									<p>The recipes section allows members to contribute recipes that are categorized according to any health requirements and eating preferences like diabetes, vegan, lactose-free but the recipes will be approved by a nutritionist beforehand.

Examples of products would be: metal straws, bamboo toothbrushes, freezer containers and food containers. Restaurants are welcomed to purchase products from these online stores as well.</p>

									<p>The app provides a platform for users to either sell their unused products or to donate to people in need. Users could offer communal gardens location for people to throw their scraps for composting as well.</p>

									<h3>Live stream platform</h3>

									<h3>User accounts, communal post bloggie</h3>
									<p>The communal post bloggie allows members to voice their ideas on their 7Rs lifestyle and this will provide guidance for people that are new to this sustainability lifestyle. There would be official articles from experienced people to provide an easy guide in starting the 7Rs lifestyle. Examples of articles could be composting, facts of growing plants, recycling and how to start a veggie patch. Users could propose voluntary activities like cleaning up their environment and allow communities of the same area to participate.</p>
