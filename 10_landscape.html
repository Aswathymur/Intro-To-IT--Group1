										<p>What's out there?</p>
									</header>
									<!-- <span class="image featured"><img src="images/banner.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
									<p>There are some similar apps available in the market, however these applications focus only on particular services and features.  Some include:
										<li>SuperCook
										<p>This application has a profile feature that allows users to create a shopping list, favourites list of recipes and a pantry of ingredients that are categorised such as dairy, vegetables, spices, meat. Another feature of this app is that the user can input an ingredient from their pantry and the app will produce recipes that can be made with the ingredient (SuperCook, 2020).
										<li>Favoreats<p>
										Favoreats requires the user to create a profile which will provide the user with the features of creating a shopping list, a daily, weekly, or monthly meal plan, explore recipes and add them to a favourite collection (Favoreats, 2020).
										<li>Recipes Home<p>
										The application, Recipes Home provides four main pages including, meals, drinks, favourites, and shopping list. This application has social integration and allows users to log in/sign up with either Google or Facebook. Recipes Home provides recipes with the nutritional information, ingredient list, and instructions (Recipes Home, 2020).
										<li>Plant Jammer<p>
										This application provides the users with features such as creating their own recipes, meal plan for the week, shopping list and provides recipes that can include ingredients to “empty” their fridge. The user is to create a profile before being able to use the application (Plant Jammer, 2020).<p>
											<h1>Whats our point of difference?</h1>
										This project will produce an application that has the following features: a recipes page, environmentally friendly stores for fresh food and products, livestream platform, communal post bloggy section, ingredients/pantry page. The feature of the ingredients and pantry page will provide the user with the tools to reduce excessive buying and update their current pantry.<p>

										<p>The communal post section allows users to share a variety of things, including recipes, nutritional tips, methods to sustainably consume food whether through cooking or things such as composting. The livestream platform will be used for “cooking classes” or sharing cooking tips over a livestream in which users can host or join. This tool can also be utilised to share any nutritional information about certain foods or cooking methods.
										<p>The application will provide services that will allow users to source fresh produce from stores that are environmentally friendly and sell/donate unused products. From all the recipes shared, the user will be able to search and filter through the recipes to satisfy different things, such as diets or certain foods/ingredients. The main difference of this project is that the application will provide a wider variety of features where most applications only focus on one or a limited number like the provided examples.
