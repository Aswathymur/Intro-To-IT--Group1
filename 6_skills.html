									<p>If this project were to be developed for another 6 months, the application would first of all need some product management. Therefore, the first role would be the product manager who’s job is to head the mobile app development and sort out all the requirements for the app to work by liaising with the sustainability companies that supply the necessary products for the application project.

									<p>The next position is the graphics designer and they would need to create the user interface to ensure a good user experience and appealing design. The major factors that should be focused on are quality of life features to make the app go beyond simply just suiting the user’s needs, while keeping an easy to navigate but appealing design. Having simple features that add a smooth experience and value of the app would make the app stand out more than other similar apps. The position that handles all of this would be the graphics designer.

									<p>There would be positions for software engineers as the development team would need to use modern coding languages. The app development team would need to have skilled MIT app inventors, as well as technologies like Microsoft Azure as a platform for managing and deploying applications and services. Cross-platform capabilities allow members to translate apps into Android, iOS and Windows. The data expertise should be stored in efficient databases and repositories and for users to have a good performing app that functions smoothly. An integration with cloud-hosted systems could help pushing data into those systems or pulling data out, developers would need to be experienced in push notifications.

									<p>A business manager role may be necessary for their writing skills in order to be able to deliver easily understandable messages to the users of the app. Having business analysis skills and experience could translate the vision of the product and produce good results. Moreover, the business manager would be useful for managing logs, balances and checks.

									<p>Lastly, a position related to cyber security may be necessary as there will be online transactions tol allow members to purchase sustainable products and groceries. Customer privacy will be very important and each user will need to be secure and safe from compromise. The tool of OAuth would be used for allowing users to log in using social media accounts, this will prevent any need for passwords and it is convenient to use (Firenze, 2016).
