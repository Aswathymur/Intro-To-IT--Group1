									<h2>Individual and Group Reflection</h2>
									<h3>Group Reflection</h3>
									<p>Even with a big group of seven, we were able to work together well without conflict. Group meetings and brainstorming sessions were consistent and each person completed their sections on time after each meeting. Throughout our many meetings, we were able to work together efficiently and there was good time management within the group to ensure that the assignment was constantly progressing. Each group member showed a good sense of responsibility in finishing their assignment sections selected before each meeting which helped us to finish the assignment on time. The brainstorming sessions for the project idea was good and members also gave their feedback on how it could be improved further.</p>

									<p>The things that could be improved in our group is the feedback skills, even though there is less feedback or criticism given within the group, group members are more agreeable towards ideas, this helps the progress of the assignment to be completed fast and there was no argument that happened. The only weakness of the group is that there was no official leader that was nominated and instead there were a few members that were quick in providing ideas and direction for the team therefore it could be slightly time consuming when we have an issue but it had eventually been resolved through emailing to the tutor. What I have learned about this specific group is to not be afraid to ask questions as it is always better to ask if there is any lingering doubt and not leave it until the end of assignment. Not to mention that, this particular group is friendly and helpful which is always beneficial. There was never a need for us to delegate specific tasks for each person to contribute to the assignment but instead when someone asks for help, multiple members would volunteer themselves to help out.</p>

									<p>For the github website, we were all contributing in solving any issue faced by members and would provide comments in improving each section. This assignment gave us incentive to figure out the requirements for our ideal jobs and we were able to keep in mind what we need to do to achieve our ideal jobs. Overall, even though our group is considered big and consists of 7 members, we were all very proactive and quick in response to help each other in to complete this assignment on time.</p>

									<h3>Individual Reflection</h3>
									<h4>Sue Wei Low</h4>
									<p>Each person contributed equally for the project and there was a good response and we helped each other on their parts if team members needed help with their sections. One point that could be improved is to have someone to double check the content included in the section so that it would be made better. It is surprising that everyone in the group are of different ethnicity but there was not any communication issue or stress given to each other but instead throughout our meetings, we enjoyed each otherâ€™s company and we had mini catchup sessions to ensure that everyone was well. Any questions related to the assignment were discussed among members during the meetings and further issues that were unclear about the assignment were raised to the tutor for clarification and the response was passed to all group members which is excellent to ensure that our assignment was clear. Our teamwork skills and understanding of each other has made the assignment easier and unexpectedly having a bigger group is workable too but it requires high response and participation. The assignment was finished quickly and details were transferred to github and there were constant improvement ideas given by members.</p>

									<h4>Joseph</h4>
									<p>From the beginning of the assignment, I believe the group has been able to communicate seamlessly in which everyone was able to express their ideas and gain feedback about issues they encountered without any judgement. We were able to brainstorm ideas quickly and delegate tasks evenly. Unlike other groups I have encountered, everyone had a positive attitude toward the assignment, completing tasks on time and contributing to weekly meetings. What surprised me was how quickly our group was able to set dates and times for meetings, due to the pandemic we never get to interact with each other in person, however it did not hinder our ability to work as a group. What I have learnt from working in groups is that everyone has their unique point of view on how to approach different tasks, this gives a more in depth understanding of different tasks and the ability to see things that you have missed. </p>
