									<h2>Individual and Group Reflection</h2>
									<h3>Group Reflection</h3>
									<p>Even with a big group of seven, we were able to work together well without conflict. Group meetings and brainstorming sessions were consistent and each person completed their sections on time after each meeting. Throughout our many meetings, we were able to work together efficiently and there was good time management within the group to ensure that the assignment was constantly progressing. Each group member showed a good sense of responsibility in finishing their assignment sections selected before each meeting which helped us to finish the assignment on time. The brainstorming sessions for the project idea was good and members also gave their feedback on how it could be improved further.</p>

									<p>The things that could be improved in our group is the feedback skills, even though there is less feedback or criticism given within the group, group members are more agreeable towards ideas, this helps the progress of the assignment to be completed fast and there was no argument that happened. The only weakness of the group is that there was no official leader that was nominated and instead there were a few members that were quick in providing ideas and direction for the team therefore it could be slightly time consuming when we have an issue but it had eventually been resolved through emailing to the tutor. What I have learned about this specific group is to not be afraid to ask questions as it is always better to ask if there is any lingering doubt and not leave it until the end of assignment. Not to mention that, this particular group is friendly and helpful which is always beneficial. There was never a need for us to delegate specific tasks for each person to contribute to the assignment but instead when someone asks for help, multiple members would volunteer themselves to help out.</p>

									<p>For the github website, we were all contributing in solving any issue faced by members and would provide comments in improving each section. This assignment gave us incentive to figure out the requirements for our ideal jobs and we were able to keep in mind what we need to do to achieve our ideal jobs. Overall, even though our group is considered big and consists of 7 members, we were all very proactive and quick in response to help each other in to complete this assignment on time.</p>

									<h3>Individual Reflection</h3>

									<p>Each person contributed equally for the project and there was a good response and we helped each other on their parts if team members needed help with their sections. One point that could be improved is to have someone to double check the content included in the section so that it would be made better. It is surprising that everyone in the group are of different ethnicity but there was not any communication issue or stress given to each other but instead throughout our meetings, we enjoyed each other’s company and we had mini catchup sessions to ensure that everyone was well. Any questions related to the assignment were discussed among members during the meetings and further issues that were unclear about the assignment were raised to the tutor for clarification and the response was passed to all group members which is excellent to ensure that our assignment was clear. Our teamwork skills and understanding of each other has made the assignment easier and unexpectedly having a bigger group is workable too but it requires high response and participation. The assignment was finished quickly and details were transferred to github and there were constant improvement ideas given by members.</p>

									<p>From the beginning of the assignment, I believe the group has been able to communicate seamlessly in which everyone was able to express their ideas and gain feedback about issues they encountered without any judgement. We were able to brainstorm ideas quickly and delegate tasks evenly. Unlike other groups I have encountered, everyone had a positive attitude toward the assignment, completing tasks on time and contributing to weekly meetings. What surprised me was how quickly our group was able to set dates and times for meetings, due to the pandemic we never get to interact with each other in person, however it did not hinder our ability to work as a group. What I have learnt from working in groups is that everyone has their unique point of view on how to approach different tasks, this gives a more in depth understanding of different tasks and the ability to see things that you have missed. </p>

									<p>Overall I am really happy to work with this group as everyone contributed fairly, equally and most importantly there is no conflict in this group which is always wonderful. In addition, the fact that everyone is helpful to each other and is willing to contribute more than what they are asked to do for the group is very delightful. However, what can be improved is maybe on the communication side where some may misinterpreted what was discussed during group discussion, so it is always good to double clarify. What surprised me about this group and each individual is how quick we respond to each other despite having a large number of people in the group, and also not to mention we are all quite flexible and open minded too, compared to previous experiences with older groups. In regards to what I have learned about this group is how important communication is, being that said, everyone is very attentive which is great. Furthermore, if any of us raised a question, everyone will help out in their own way and most of the time the answer is given very quickly which is good, as this clarifies any doubt. </p>

									<p>This group has been very cohesive and easy going whilst also getting all the work required done in a timely manner. Instead of it being a chore to work out when to meet everyone has been eager which in turn has then made it enjoyable to attend and made our meetings very productive. Having seven people in a group that can’t meet face to face provides challenges within itself but the group as a whole has managed to navigate any challenges this could have caused with ease. I am looking forward to working further with these group members. I learned that even without face to face meetings we were able to achieve everything, maybe even more than normal as it seems like everyone was extra motivated and were embracing the change of situation. There wasn’t a whole lot that could be improved in some of our meetings we would simply meet and all knew what we were doing so it was more of a time to do assignment work than a meeting but it worked for us.</p>

									<p>In completing the assignment, the group was able to work in a collaborative manner through effective communication and teamwork. From the beginning, we were able to establish tasks that were to be completed and who would contribute to each to maximise efficiency. Given the circumstances, working as a group online is different to working on campus.  However, we were able to overcome any struggles online. As a large group of seven, it would be expected that there would be conflicts and disagreements amongst team members, but it was surprising as there were such events. Despite this, each individual brought a productive and open mindset in meetings and discussions. This was evident through the meetings as tasks were completed in an engaging way as we were able to enjoy ourselves whilst progressing through the work. One thing I learnt is that working in groups shouldn’t always be strictly work-related but building relationships as it can make the task more enjoyable. This assignment is beneficial as it provides an understanding of what could be important for us in the future in terms of a job. To sum up, the team worked productively throughout the completion of the assignment through meetings and cooperation.</p>

									<p>From beginning to the end, the assignment went smoothly. The entire assignment was split into a number of parts, with each member picking which part they wanted to do and leaving some parts to members who did not mind doing the sections leftover. I feel there may have been a little unevenness in the splitting of work. However, everyone was supportive of one another and it made working on this assignment feel meaningful. The weekly meetings coupled with the lectorial meetings were very helpful, as it allowed everyone to listen to who was who and start to recognize each other, which I thought would take longer considering that seven people is a large group. I feel like there is still a little bit of shyness amongst some people, especially when working online will always be less personal than working in person. Even so, after a few weeks, we had a routine developed and planned what we wanted to achieve week by week which worked well in conjunction with hearing each other communicate and watching each other’s work live using google docs.</p>

										<p>The group worked together with shared parts. The team also completed their tasks on time and were able to work in harmony. We had several meetings throughout, and every member of the team attended the meeting. If in rare circumstances, one of the team members were not available for the day, the team worked out another suitable time. Despite the big numbers the group still managed to respond to each other queries when in need and also bonded over the many meetings we have had. It was surprising to see that a team worked perfectly fine and most importantly with no conflicts without even meeting each other. The team only met through the many meetings we have had, and these meetings have truly helped us bond. From the first meeting, we had set clear agenda’s that was met and before closing the meeting we had also prepared our tasks to complete by the next meeting and the goal for the next meeting. Finishing the second assignment as a team has given me confidence to work further and put in my best effort for the betterment of the team.</p>
