										<h2>Plans and progress</h2>

									<p>As mentioned in the previous sections, the plan is to bring awareness of the importance of sustainability, 7Rs and being healthy conscious. There are multiple sections in the app which are recipes, online fresh food and products shop, live stream platform, communal post bloggie. The plan for the app is to create a platform where people can provide ideas on how they live a sustainable life and there are options to allow communities to create voluntary events.


									<p>The 7Rs would be promoted through various ways in the app:
									<li>Rethink
									<p>Members exchange items or give away used items to people in need.
									Smart Fridge capacity notification to allow users to rethink over purchasing groceries and not to double buy items.
									<li>Refuse
									<p>Purchase from sustainable and eco-friendly online stores in the app that minimise plastic wrappings.
									<li>Reduce
									<p>Blogs, livestream that gives insight about ways to reduce waste.
									Recipes that uses leftover fresh produce in the pantry to minimize spoilage.
									Reducing water usage through usage of rainwater and recycling water from washing machine.
									Blogs abouts scraps from fruit peels could be used for cleaning enzymes.
									Livestream or blogs that teach members to make environmentally friendly soap or detergents.
									<li>Reuse
									<p>Ideas to reuse old items in the house for new purposes provided by experienced members.
									<li>Repair
									<p>Blogs and live streams that teach members to repair broken items.
									<li>Rot
									<p>Blogs that allow members to create voluntary activities to community farms to learn about composting.
									Live stream that teaches ways to start composting.
									Members or community farms that accept scraps list themselves in the app and the members’ exchange section.
									<li>Recycle
									<p>Articles about recycling used items to create new items.



									<p>The app would begin with a login page or sign up page that would identify the person’s account, saving data such as search history, past activity, saved drafts as well as recognising the owners of blogs or livestreams to allow for more privileges in editing their posts.

									<p><h1>Recipes</h1>
									<p>Ideally, the user would write about various details on their recipe, explaining their reason for liking the recipe which could be simply that they enjoy the combination of flavours, or that it is simple to prepare and easy to make. Additionally, they could suggest optional ingredients that could add different flavours that may work depending on person to person, or go into depth on the nutritional values of their recipe. This recipe would be placed in a pending section, waiting to be checked by a nutritionist to be labelled under different categories like for lactose intolerant, diabetes friendly, and go through a filtering system for any inappropriate language or blatant misinformation. Once valid, the recipe will be officially posted and ready to be seen or reviewed and rated by every user.

									<p>On the viewer’s side, the plan will be to provide a home screen displaying trending recipes or recipes related to what they have searched for or what they gave high ratings to before. There will be two search features which allows users to either search for recipes via name or if they simply want to know what recipes they can use with their available ingredients, they can search by selecting ingredients which the app will then compare with the tags on the recipe and decide which to display in the search for the user. The user can then pick a recipe and read the details on the respective recipe, following the recipe if they want to try it and commenting or reviewing it depending on their opinions.

									<p>The comments and reviews can create discussion and interactivity between everyone, bringing new possibilities and more information on the recipe, whether it be different use of ingredients, possible substitutes, alternative methods that may make the preparation or cooking easier or simply more nutritional or historical information on the recipe.

									<p>Additionally, instead of blogging, users could run a live stream to give a live demonstration on how their recipes work, or could have some casual session trying out recipes on the app that they have never seen before. This would not only teach people about history or reasons why each ingredient is a part of the whole recipe, or to how to cook all in a live session, but it could also encourage people to cook alongside or take notes. A live session also has the advantages of being able to communicate with the streamer in real time, allowing people to leave some messages if they have questions on methods.

									<p>Users could find recipes that use their leftover fresh produce and so this would limit their food waste. The smart fridge would show the purchase date of the fresh product. There would be less chances of food wastage as the app would organise and recommend meals for users. Members could pick their preferred cuisine and dietary requirements and the app would only select applicable recipes for them.

									<p>Lastly, users could check buy fresh products that they require and not available in their smart fridge.They can simply press and hold an ingredient in the search or a tag on the recipe, this will allow them to add products into their cart and purchase through the online eco friendly and sustainable online stores. After confirming that the user has given permission to access their location or simply typing in their location, the goods would be transported to their house after purchase, the details of delivery date and time would be stated on their online receipt.


									<p><h1>Environmental friendly stores for fresh food and products and members’ exchange platform</h1>
									<p>There are online stores sections in the app that allows people to purchase in eco-friendly and sustainable stores that are able to provide fresh products in bulk and that limits plastic waste. Members are able to purchase daily essentials like reusable bags, reusable straws or toothbrushes. The online stores are able to promote the 7Rs by providing reusable products. Community farms could sell their fresh produce to people and that promotes organic food and healthy eating. Farmers could sell their fresh produce quicker through listing it under the online stores section and minimize spoilage. Members are able to refuse single-use plastic through purchasing goods from eco-friendly online stores.

									<p>The recipe section and smart pantry would be linked to the online stores platform for users convenience in purchasing fresh produce needed for their recipes. Online shops would reuse fresh produce boxes to deliver items to customers and they would minimize use of plastic bags. Bulk buying is encouraged by the online stores and discounts would be given when members purchase a higher amount of products or fresh produce. The smart pantry would show users products that are already available at home which would allow members to rethink before purchasing fresh products. Users could fill up their fridge size and the app would estimate the available space and notify users if they had over purchased fresh goods and their fridge would not be able to store all the groceries. This would promote rethink and reduce members’ purchase decisions.

									<p>In order to promote the 7Rs, there is a platform that allows members to list their unused items for people in need. To promote composting, community farms or other homes that accept scraps could list themselves there, therefore users could find their nearest compost host to give their scraps. To promote Rethink in the 7Rs, members could put their unused items for people to borrow to minimize the need to purchase new items like camping gear or surfboards.

									<p><h1>Live stream platform</h1>
									<p>The live stream platform available in the app increases interactions between users. Members are able to live stream their meal prepping and allow them to create polls for followers to decide what they should include in their meal. This will help members and their followers to bond and interact. There are also a variety of livestream activities available to educate members on the 7Rs and sustainability lifestyle ideas. Nutritionists could also give talks about healthy eating and ways to minimize common health problems. Community farms could give a demonstration on how they do composting and encourage members to participate in starting a compost. Members could show how they use scraps from fruit peels to make enzymes for cleaning and teach other people about making environmentally friendly soap or detergents.

									<p>The live stream platform will show a list of live streams and videos available to watch and are categorized according to different interests. Members could comment or give a reaction to the live stream that they are watching.

									<p><h1>User accounts, communal post bloggie</h1>
									<p>The communal post bloggie is used by members and people in the same community to communicate and voice their ideas in their ways in living a sustainable lifestyle which they would practice the 7Rs in their daily life. There are also articles written by experienced people with knowledge on ways to start living the 7Rs lifestyle. The articles could be ways to start composting, starting a veggie patch, reusing old items common at home. Communities could gather people around the same area to do voluntary activities like joining community farms, and free food for people in need.

									<p>Experienced users could post about their ways to practice “Reduce” in the 7Rs by reusing rainwater to water plants or recycling washing machine water to flush toilets. The blog is categorised into different sections of the 7Rs for easy access. Recycling could be promoted by linking articles about reusing old items for new projects.

									<p>User accounts could allow people to follow each other’s account, a list of their bloggie posts, pictures, attempted recipes, their biodata, their live streams.

									<p>The plan to make these features a reality through the use of a variety of tools. Figma will be used to design the interface that users will interact with, which includes:
									<li>Posting and reading blogs, comments and reviews.
									<li>The search and filter features.
									<li>Live streaming functions.
									<li>Shopping functions (items, cart, checkout, delivery).</li>

									<p>User specific data, such as blogs or live streams owned by a user will be saved in a small cloud server using Microsoft Azure. This will allow adaptive storage of the growing database of recipes should the app become popular in the future. OAuth is an internet protocol that will be useful for security purposes such as for editing posts as the owner or using the online store.

									<p>As of the present, a Figma prototype of the website has been created. The purpose of this prototype is to create a general visualisation of the app. While the design is certainly subjective to change in the future, as of the present the prototype has a placeholder login/signup page. Logging in will lead to the main page where the user can find popular recipes, see their smart fridge capacity and items and a list of ingredients that do not have a function as of yet. There is one blog and video in their respective list that has a function and shows how the layout will generally be. You can check blogs in the feed as well as check your profile where you can log off.

									<p>In the future, the plan would be to implement all the incomplete features of the prototype, perhaps make the design more appealing and create a release of the application to the world. The release would require much preparation to maintain the app, which may open up job positions for various people with programming, app design, cyber security and app management skills.
