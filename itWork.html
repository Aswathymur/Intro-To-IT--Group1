									<h2>IT Work</h2>
									<h3><a href="https://au.linkedin.com/in/catherine-perrett-81393487">Catherine Perrett</h3></a>
										<strong>1. Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?</strong>
										<p>Catherine has worked at Deloitte for 4 years starting as a graduate then working up to senior consultant. Where do you work? A senior consultant at Deloitte in Melbourne in analytics and cognitive, her speciality is data management. Catherine’s role is changing frequently as a consultant she will be put on to different jobs/projects depending on where there is a need. Partners at her firm will sell work to clients and she will then be allocated accordingly depending on need. For the most part her projects are quite long in length from 6 months or longer. </p>

										<strong>2. Please tell us about the industry you work in</strong>
										<p>Catherine is currently working on a project for Telstra in personalised marketing – data ingestion work for a Bigdata platform. Bigdata is a platform where companies gather huge amounts of data and then apply machine learning based on particular events of data that happen to create a database. Teams then grab this data from a data-lake, analyse it and then use it to make decisions. Scrum master/project managers are required for getting the data into the system (ingestion) and then they have the role of managing the work for coders/developers to design the ingestion pattern.
										<p>The industry Catherine works in is consulting is very broad. For Catherine she is more technical and does long implementation projects. They can vary from 6 months to 6 years. Tech is changing quite frequently and this is especially important for consultants to be well experienced in the latest technologies as companies are coming to Deloitte and asking for their assistance in implementing projects as they are not as familiar/capable of achieving them on their own.</p>

										<strong>3. What other kinds of work do you have to do?</strong>
										<p>As she is a consultant it is primarily project work.
										So bringing back knowledge and assets is important for the business and would be considered other work as well as studying and learning new skills to stay at the forefront of technology. An example is she attended a course run by Amazon web services to educate them about new technologies and services that will be coming available.</p>

										<strong>4. Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about them.</strong>
										<p>Project team (internal Deloitte colleagues), stakeholders (currently Telstra) – one main point of contact (product owner) and weekly talk to the head of the project (the product owner’s manager), she also interacts with a virtual team based in Delhi who are on a different time zones and it involves completely virtual working. She was on this project before COVID started and so working from home meant nothing really changed with contacting that team anyway. Catherine went on to say how it is quite common in the industry that coding in particular is outsourced to their Deloitte colleagues in overseas locations as they are a lot cheaper to put on projects. </p>

										<strong>5. Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals.</strong>
										<p>A lot of different IT roles ranging from Technical BA’s to developers and projector managers. Being able to have conversations with the technical level people as well as also being able to communicate to people about the bigger project idea is critical as she will often be the person communicating backwards and forwards between her team in Delhi and stakeholders at Telstra or her own manager at Deloitte. This becomes important as you progress up through the company as your language and interactions will change depending on who you talk to and as you progress up through the ranks.</p>

										<strong>6. What about your interactions with clients or investors?</strong>
										<p>Within consulting the more senior you become the more interaction you have with the clients and selling work to them. At all levels, you work at the client’s site (95% of projects spent on site) for normal business hours. Big companies invest into Deloitte as it is beneficial for them to be experienced in their technologies to sell to clients. For example if Amazon or Google have new cloud technology that business could implement they invest in companies like Deloitte who are then able to help other businesses take advantage of this new technology.</p>

										<strong>7. What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these.</strong>
										<p>As a manager mainly planning the work for the team and triaging incidents. Her current team works on a development operations model (designing and reviewing code) and then implementing it – and then the remaining 20% of the time managing risk and issues on the system that have been implemented by her and the team.</p>

										<strong>8. Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging?</strong>
										<p>She said that starting projects when you’ve got new clients, new expectations, learning the ins and outs of the new client, new and different technologies to onboard are particular challenges faced especially at the start of a job/project. Clients have a high expectation as costs for consultants is expensive. Basically being thrown in the deep at the start of the project and having to show deliverables to a client early to demonstrate that the money that they are spending will be worth it and to hopefully have the projects extended not by failing to deliver but by being able to offer more than what was initially proposed.</p>

										<strong>9. Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry?</strong>
										<p>The essence of consulting allows people to not be locked down into one particular area and if they don’t enjoy something, they can change projects. Data governance, reporting, ingestion, dashboarding, Bigdata are all the things Catherine has been involved in to this point. Catherine enjoys the challenge of starting new projects and has moved onto a flagship project at Telstra which is now a baseline for other projects that can be done for other companies.</p>
