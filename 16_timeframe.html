											<th> Week 2</th>
											<th>Decided on a team name and a project idea. Respective parts of the assignment 2 were being finalized, completed and moved onto GitHub. Focus is now on the project idea, everyone has to think of ideas for the application name and features that can be implemented onto the application. Research was also done by all members of ways to promote sustainability, healthy eating and to gain a better understanding of the 7R’s.</th>
												</tr>
											<tr>
												<th>Week 3 </th>
												<th> Data gathered from the research was collected and ideas discussed. Key features were brainstormed by all group members. An application name was decided on. Ideas for an application name were discussed, and required more time to brainstorm. Potential features of the application were discussed and the purpose of the application was being decided. Further research was conducted to find potential users of the application, the group was split, half the members had begun conducting user research while the other half began researching the necessary tools required to create an application concurrently everyone was contributing to finalize assignment 2 and reviewing all segments then moving them to Github.</th>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<th>Week 4</th>
												<th>Assignment 3 is underway, a decision to change the website layout for the assignment was made. For everyone to gain a better insight into the project idea, the vision for the application was established and key features established. A discussion of what  we envision our final product.  Different segments of the project were delegated by ability. Members with excellent research abilities had continued to fine tune other features that could be implemented. Those with exceptional planning abilities had begun planning the adequate steps required to reach our end goal. A timeframe was set in which we would like to see the project progress. </th>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<th>Week 5 </th>
												<th>As more research was conducted for the application, it was found many aspects were still lacking. The team had begun designing a logo for the application. Everyone has been informed of how to access the prototype and shown how to operate Figma. Focus is now shifted on the creation of the prototype. Research for the project is progressing and further features were discussed. The scope of the project and where we wanted to be was established. Everyone is continuing working on their parts, however through the nature of the project required collaboration with various team members. While everyone had a “segment” assistance from other members was crucial as the different fields overlapped. </th>

											<tr>
												<th>Week 6 </th>
												<th>The general layout of the application is now completed and a visual prototype is available. A logo for the application was agreed on. The project idea was being improved and more brainstorming was required after some feedback was received. All aspects of the project are finalized, and all relevant data are obtained. The team was split once again into individuals creating who are to create the report and continuation of the prototype creation. The key components of the application can now be tested and a working prototype has been made.  </th>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<th>Week 7 </th>
												<th>Finalization of the prototype, all members are to test the features and give feedback on the design and processes of the application. After discussion and feedback, further design and changes might be required for the application. Begin to conduct usability testing, by finding potential users for trial of the application. All group members will be required to interview different potential users and surveys will be conducted to find issues within the application and its design. The report has been completed and ready to pitch to potential shareholders/collaborators. A graphic designer will be sought after to review the application design/layout. Begin searching for a software engineer who can begin the creation of the application, and also a business manager who understands how to market out application.  </th>
