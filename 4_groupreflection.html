									<p>As a whole group, I believe that we were able to work together well with minimal issues of communication. Everyone attended most meetings on time and contributed equally to the assignment. During meetings, we had asked for more clarification to the changes we made in the document. As this assignment is a continuation of the project idea, most parts in the assignment were linked to each other. It was important to communicate the changes we made to the idea and ensuring that everyone understood the app features. After reading the sections of the assignment, some members also gave comments to improve or to clarify the progress of the section. All sections were listed and colour coded to mark the completion of the section and whether it had been transferred to the website. 

									<p>The prototype was done by multiple members and they shared their screen during meetings to show and ask for opinion to improve. Further clarification and improvement of the app idea was communicated at this time. Members were very helpful and open to new ideas. As we were continuously thinking of new features of the app, it sometimes became complicated and misunderstood. I am glad that members were still very patient in making changes to the prototype after they had cleared any misunderstanding. In order to be fair, we also discussed and planned who to give a brief explanation of our progress during tutorials every week. Members were very initiative to discuss the feedback received from assignment two and ensured that everyone was aware of any changes that needed to be made for assignment 3. Because everyone had a different understanding of the feedback received, we voiced out what we think should be changed and came up with the best solution and updates. 
									
									<p>In the beginning when we formed our group, we had understood each person’s characteristics through the quizzes done and understood each other’s interest. This helped us to understand how each member could contribute to the assignment. Some of us are better in IT technology due to previous studies and interest, they helped with problem solving any issue with the github website and navigating the figma. Some members are more initiative in planning the assignment and separating tasks that need to be completed. Everyone’s unique characteristic and interest became our strength and motivation in completing the assignment. Our group members are responsible and reliable, they keep to their promises when they pick a section of the assignment, they are able to complete it on time and ask for help when they are facing an issue.
