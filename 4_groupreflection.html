										<h2>Group Reflection</h2>

									<p>As a whole group, I believe that we were able to work together well with minimal issues of communication. Everyone attended most meetings on time and contributed equally to the assignment. During meetings, we had asked for more clarification to the changes we made in the document. As this assignment is a continuation of the project idea, most parts in the assignment were linked to each other. It was important to communicate the changes we made to the idea and ensuring that everyone understood the app features. After reading the sections of the assignment, some members also gave comments to improve or to clarify the progress of the section. All sections were listed and colour coded to mark the completion of the section and whether it had been transferred to the website. 

									<p>The prototype was done by multiple members and they shared their screen during meetings to show and ask for opinion to improve. Further clarification and improvement of the app idea was communicated at this time. Members were very helpful and open to new ideas. As we were continuously thinking of new features of the app, it sometimes became complicated and misunderstood. I am glad that members were still very patient in making changes to the prototype after they had cleared any misunderstanding. In order to be fair, we also discussed and planned who to give a brief explanation of our progress during tutorials every week. Members were very initiative to discuss the feedback received from assignment two and ensured that everyone was aware of any changes that needed to be made for assignment 3. Because everyone had a different understanding of the feedback received, we voiced out what we think should be changed and came up with the best solution and updates. 
									
									<p>In the beginning when we formed our group, we had understood each person’s characteristics through the quizzes done and understood each other’s interest. This helped us to understand how each member could contribute to the assignment. Some of us are better in IT technology due to previous studies and interest, they helped with problem solving any issue with the github website and navigating the figma. Some members are more initiative in planning the assignment and separating tasks that need to be completed. Everyone’s unique characteristic and interest became our strength and motivation in completing the assignment. Our group members are responsible and reliable, they keep to their promises when they pick a section of the assignment, they are able to complete it on time and ask for help when they are facing an issue.

										<h2>Individual Reflection</h2> </header>
										<P>After a semester of working with the team I think we have done substantially well with the completion of all the assignments. We were able to easily split the workload into even parts. Tasks were completed on time and everyone was active and present at all meetings. Everyone has brought a positive attitude for the work and genuinely cares about the quality of the assignment. What contributed to the smooth processes of the group and how  well we had worked together was through the weekly meetings, where we were able to address issues and collaborate new ideas that may be added to the assignment. Also working together on Google Docs rather than individually with each other’s parts, we were able to see the progress of other group members and help when needed. Initially something that could be improved was the team's ability to make decisions, however this was quickly addressed as we had come up with a voting system to decide. A surprising thing I found was even with seven people, there were no conflicts between any members or ideas everyone was able to get along. The main thing I have learnt from working in a group is that there are many ways to interpret a problem, everyone has their unique view of how to address questions and that the collaboration of ideas that contribute to solving them is why working in groups is very beneficial. (Joseph)
											
										<P>As a group we have well achieved what we needed to do and have contributed fairly. Throughout the process from assignment 2 and now assignment 3, we all had developed and strengthened numerous skills, at the same time also significantly refining our knowledge on various IT skills that we already knew. I felt that the constant meeting we have once every week really helps with our assignments as we were able to come together and work on it, instead of just the regular separating task and work individually method, which in this assignment will not work well. I think what could possibly be improved is maybe on the communication where we need to understand each other’s perspectives and work together with it. One thing that surprised me is that everyone actually cares about putting in work and contributing as much as they can, not only that but also being really helpful with each other if help is needed. Lastly, the one thing I have learnt about groups is that do not be afraid to ask for help if needed and be open to contribute more ideas because sometimes it can be ideal. (Kien)
											
										<P>After working with the team for the whole semester, I think all of us became better at working in a large group of seven people. Teamwork and cooperation worked really well in the group overall and we have separated tasks a few times to ensure that the assignment could be completed on time. Having meetings at a timely basis helps us to resolve problems and everyone is able to brainstorm ideas during meetings. I think having timeline dates set for the group would speed up the completion of the assignment but even without it, we were able to complete the assignments on time. It was surprising that everyone is really committed to meetings and sometimes our meetings could last 2 to 3 hours because we were problem solving and members were all very patient and helping throughout the whole time. Helping each other to find a solution for problems faced by team members benefits all of us as we are able to think and learn at the same time. I have learnt that helping each other in a team and asking for help when facing an issue is the key to improve the quality of the assignment. (SUE)
											
										<P>Each member was both good at working individually and as a team. Whenever some members had assessments and were too busy to work on the project, the members that were not busy stepped up and helped each other. This combined with good organisation of tasks allowed the team to work flexibly, with members taking different roles whenever necessary, thus finishing the project with little wasted time on miscommunication. I think the workflow became stronger since assignment 2 as everyone was more confident for this assignment, sharing with each other any troubles and getting solutions to them quickly rather than leaving them for later. One difficulty I think was a small issue in the assignment was the amount of sections that linked with each other. In assignment 2, most sections were disconnected from each other and could be written individually with little editing afterwards. However, this assignment required many recaps/expanding on ideas which could get confusing, especially with 7 contributors. I have learned that when working in a group, especially when in larger groups, communication and organisation is very important, as it reduces the chance of confusion, delegates tasks to members so that they can do what they are strong at, as well as allow members to help others where necessary. (Kevin)

										<P>From equal contribution, we were able to efficiently complete the assignment and project. Being in this team was comforting as other members were understanding and empathetic for being busy and having other assignments which was not a problem for the team completing the work. If a member missed something, a recap was written for those affected members to be brought up to speed. As all the meetings were conducted over Microsoft Teams, the meeting times were flexible and could go over a longer period of time of productive work. However, more communication and discussion could have taken place in the meetings. A benefit of being in a large team was that members were able and ready to help other members. However, the assignment was quite disjointed at the beginning carrying on from assignment 2. This could be from having different opinions or visions for the application/project, which can be mended through constant communication. However, through continuous meetings and discussion, we were able to rectify this. Towards the end of the assignment, we were able to produce a website, a prototype and a report with the relevant information. Ultimately,I have enjoyed the overall experience of working with this group. (Brandon)

										<P>This assignment has been quite straight forward in terms of group cohesion. We were able to continue on with momentum from assignment 2 and work fairly consistently checking off little steps most weeks. There was a slight hiccup with my schedule for one of our meetings as I was moving house and completely forgot about our weekend meeting but my team was very understanding and filled me in with everything I missed. We realised from A2 that our meetings weren’t filled with constant communication so we tried to shorten them and increase our discussion but this could still be improved. Face to face meetings might have been useful for that. Despite the difficulties of covid though I think this was a really solid team effort and everyone was highly committed to achieving a good assignment and project. For this assignment and assignment 2 I would say the on going joke of group assignments being a nightmare does not hold true at all. It has always been a pleasure working with everyone and I hope maybe we cross paths with them again in the future. (Dan)
											
										<P>The assignment has been a very pleasant journey throughout. From planning to all the tasks being completed on time, the team has always worked together and in unity. The meeting was attended by all members and in rare circumstances when one of us are not able to attend, the members in the team gave the member a briefing on the whole meeting and the agenda’s set for the next meeting. Taking on board all the feedback we got from the lecturer after our A2, we made sure our meetings were shorter and more effective than our previous long ones. We made a few changes with our writing styles as well to put us in a better spot this time. The team has always worked in harmony and this truly reflects on the outcome of our project. Every idea and every decision that was made throughout the project was a unanimous decision. There are a lot of aspects in this group assignments that helped all the members of the team learn and improve as individuals. Even during these tough times, the team has worked well together.
