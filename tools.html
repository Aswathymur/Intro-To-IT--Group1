									<h2>Tools</h2>
									<h3>Website Link:</h3>
									<h3>GitHub Link:</h3>
									<p>To conduct regular meetings, we used the platform, Microsoft Teams. Another tool we used to create the website was GitHub. From observing the commits on the GitHub page, it can be seen that each member of the team has been able to contribute to the GitHub repository. There were a number of branches created before merging to maintain consistency within the group. For example, there were a number of cases when members were uploading files, updating pages or merging branches.</p>
									<h4>Developing the Application - MIT App Inventor</h4>
									<p>As the project idea is an app, it has been decided that MIT app inventor will be the tool used to create the app. MIT app inventor is an online software that allows users to create apps through pre-programmed blocks. This makes the tool easy to learn.</p>
									<h5>Skills</h5>
									<p>There are a few general skills needed for this app, firstly it is product management. The product manager for the mobile app developer would need to liaise with the sustainability companies that supplies products and the project team. The next skill needed is the user interface and user experience and design. Users are attracted to attractive apps that suit their needs and are easy to navigate. The appearance of the app would also be a major factor that determines the customer satisfaction. Having a smooth experience and value of the app would make the app stand out more than other similar apps. The developer of the app needs to have a good skill of writing and would be able to deliver easily understandable text font and message to the users of the app. Moreover, having business analysis skills and experience could translate the vision of the product and produce good results. Team members would need to have good communication between each other to ensure the app is produced correctly and there are no miscommunication. The QA and performance testing needs to be done according to the QA testing methodologies that are set in place, agreed and followed by team members (Firenze, 2016)</p>
									<p>The software engineering skills that the development team needs include modern coding languages. The app development team needs to have skilled MIT app inventors. The team should be able to use technologies like Microsoft Azure as a platform for managing and deploying applications and services. Cross-platform capabilities allow members to translate apps into Android, iOS and Windows. The data expertise should be stored in efficient databases and repositories and for users to have a good performing app that functions smoothly. An integration with cloud-hosted systems could help pushing data into those systems or pulling data out, developers would need to be experienced in push notifications. Lastly, the security of the app is an important skill to have. There are online transactions which allow members to purchase sustainable products and groceries. Customersâ€™ privacy needs to be secured and safe from compromise. Logs, balances and checks would need to be in place. The tool of OAuth would be used for allowing users to log in using social media accounts, this will prevent any need for passwords and it is convenient to use (Firenze, 2016).</p>
