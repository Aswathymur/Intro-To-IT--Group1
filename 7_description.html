										<h2>Project Description</h2>

									<span class="image featured"><img src="images/banner.jpg" alt="" /></span>

									<p>Our project is to create an app that allows people  to share their opinions and discussion or understanding of the 7Rs, healthy eating and sustainability. The 7Rs are rethink, refuse, reduce, reuse, repurpose, recycle and rot. There are multiple features of the app that includes recipes page, environmental friendly stores for fresh food and products, livestream platform and communal post bloggie section.
									<p>
									The goals of the app include:
									<li>Understanding of the 7Rs and to share ideas with members.
									<li>Sharing recipes for healthy living with ingredient filter search.
									<li>Sustainable food and product sourcing
									<li>Enjoy live stream and promote inspiration to learn new tips on sustainability and recipes
									<li>Bloggie platform for members to share their ideas and create voluntary activities</li><p>

									<p>The target users are young adults and parents as they are more health conscious and place importance in a sustainable lifestyle.


									There are a few different reasons for picking this project idea because we have passions, interests, and skills in the group. Some of our group members have interest in cooking, and have met with a few problems and this app would be able to benefit them as a user. They believe that by concentrating on having a sustainable lifestyle is important and the app would make sustainable lifestyle easier through providing a platform for members to communicate their ideas and to purchase daily necessities. This app would allow new users to understand sustainability and the 7Rs through different features of the app. Some of our members are also experienced in creating an app and they find it interesting to create an online platform that combines different aspects of health and sustainability to benefit users by providing convenience as an all-in-one app.
									<p>
									We chose to supply consumers with this app due to the growing trends in the IT industry, there is an increasing awareness of healthy eating and healthy living. Consumers are looking for convenience and they are open to new apps that can fulfill their needs. Due to the constant climate change, society is becoming aware of the need to live a sustainable lifestyle that can protect nature from further damage. There is a huge issue in the world today because of the increasing amount of non-biodegradable waste like plastic waste. The app allows members to learn ways in reducing their waste through the 7Rs and learning ways to start composting.
									<p>The app brings the community together and therefore members could help their neighbours in need. People around the world are demanding for more access to reusable and degradable daily items which the app provides a shopping platform that could supply to everyone easily. Younger people in society are more conscious of what they eat to reduce health issues and maintain a healthy lifestyle. The app provides recipes that cater to different userâ€™s needs. For example, users could choose recipes that are dairy free or caters to diabetes people.
									<p>
									This project idea would build our knowledge and understanding of how we create an app and understanding the IT market and the available apps. The app creating and brainstorming of the idea would allow us to learn skills that would improve our IT skills that could benefit our future careers.
