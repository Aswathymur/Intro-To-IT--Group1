									<p>Aim: The aim of our project is to create an app to educate people on ways to reduce their waste and improve their eating habits.


									<p>Goals:
									<ol>
									<li><em>Understanding of the 7Rs and to share ideas with members</em> - we discovered a useful way of breaking down what is important within sustainability and sustainable food eating and that is the principles of the 7Râ€™s. By informing users about rethinking, refusing, reducing, reusing, repurposing, recycling and rot we can help achieve our aim.
									<li><em>Sharing recipes for healthy living with an ingredient filter search</em> - Getting people to engage by sharing recipes will help users communicate and share their recipe ideas which in turn hopefully creates increased usage of the app. The more screen time users give the app the greater chance of them recommending and sharing information and ideas they find all contributing towards our main aim.
									<li><em>Sustainable food and product sourcing</em> - Within our app we will be able to educate people on how to eat sustainably. Whether that be informing users of what products they can buy at a supermarket that are sustainable or by changing user behaviour in where they buy or get their produce from. For example letting users know where local farmers markets are and when they are happening or by having a section where people can learn how to grow their own produce.
									<li><em>Enjoy live streams and promote inspiration to learn new tips on sustainability and recipes</em> - Our app will be able to facilitate live streams of chatting guests and interviewees, drawing on the expertise and inspiration to give to our audience. Differing sources of interaction will allows us to be able to diversify our audiences and hopefully make our information accessible to everyone.
									<li><em>Blogging platform for members to share their ideas and create voluntary activities</em> - To have an area to collate and share recipes, ideas, tips, tricks and new information will facilitate everything that we are hoping to achieve. This will be an important goal as it allows for us to really spread the word and give consumers value add. The more this grows the greater reach and the most likely we are able to achieve our goals. We will give users to rate subscribe and comment on blog posts to encourage activity and will allow us to sort blogs by relevance and popularity.
									</ol>
