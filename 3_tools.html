<p><a href="https://github.com/Mystrile/Intro-To-IT--Group1">https://github.com/Mystrile/Intro-To-IT--Group1 </a> Assignment 3

<p>For this assignment, my sections include the project description, motivation, plans and progress, and some parts of the github website. I have expanded the project ideas to be more specific and made minor changes to include more of the 7Rs in the plans and progress section of the project. Creating new ideas that would support our idea to be more specific and it would make our app better than other apps in the market as it encourages more interaction between members while at the same time easy to be used. After making changes to the project idea, I would communicate the additional changes to the project idea to the team so that it would reflect it in the prototype and other sections of the assignment. (SUE)

<p>For Assignment 3 I have worked on creating a timeline that plans an outlook of the project and where our project is directed within a certain timeframe. This would give the group an insight of what stage the project is currently and how fast/slow the project is progressing. Also I have contributed to gathering the list of tools and technology needed for the completion of the project. This shows the group what is required and an oversight of the resources that will need to be learned/ further studied. (Joseph)

<p>In this assignment, I have worked on the overview, group communications, some of the plans and progress, as well as some of the skills and jobs section. I did recaps on work that needed to be done and helped with sections that still had yet to be finished. I mostly wrote about what I envisioned the project to be after listening to every member’s opinions, as well as how this project could progress in the future. (Kevin)

<p>Figma prototyping was the main task that I took on this assignment. A full working prototype for the proposed idea was the main goal, incorporating all the 7 R’s. All the features of the app came together with the apps design and the aesthetics. Every member of the team made suggestions and shared opinions to improve the apps interactions. This helps achieve the goal and the purpose of the app. (Aswathy)

<p>In assignment 3, I have contributed to the roles section, and the scope and limits section. In the Roles section, in addition also helping out on the website format. I wrote about why as a group we choose to work as a team more than just simply seperating tasks and segregating the works, I include the benefit of working as a team opposed to working individually. For the scope and limits section, I clearly defined what we needed to complete our project, what is achievable and shown and lastly the limits of this project due to some limiting nature. (Kien)

<p>For assignment 3 we had to take a bit more time in working out what each person would be best suited to doing as there was a greater variety of tasks. For myself a large portion of this assignment was involved in creating the website and putting together everyone's contributions in a readable way. The audit trail of github might be a bit misleading as that was primarily upto myself to look after whilst the others contributed more so on the content  and prototype. As well as doing the website I also did some write up of the aims and risks of the project.(Dan)

<p>For assignment 3, I contributed the testing of the project in the detailed description and the landscape of the project in the overview section. I also helped contribute to the prototype on figma, focusing on certain pages, as I have become quite familiar with figma from completing another assignment with the use of figma. In completing the testing section, I included two different strategies that can take place in COVID-19 conditions and out of COVID-19 conditions (normal conditions) and how they can be conducted. For the landscape portion of the assignment, I detailed some of the existing applications that have similar features. However, I further explained how our application from the project will be different. (Brandon)
